Practice for designing AI models from scratch

Start `mlflow server` from command.

Every folder in `models` contains a different type of model I experimented with. Some folders contain more than one model if they are used for the same class of problem - there are DNNs and CNNs in the same folder for image classification and LSTM and RNN in the same folder for timeseries prediction.
